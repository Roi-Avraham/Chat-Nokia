# Chat-Nokia

**Chat room - "whenApp"**
I worte 2 scripts in python using asyncio libary:
  1 - server
  2 - client
  
**Important note:** 
the server and client can be run on windows or linux. if you run the client in linux, you must put line 86 (in client script) in comment.

**Stages of activating the chat**
1. In the server, in lines 76 and 77 you can choose the server IP and PORT.
